Step 1: The "guide.rb" is going to be the heart of the application. ie, from "init.rb" we will instantiate the "guide.rb" class in it. It will handle all of the user input, all the processing, actions and user output as well.
We define a class Guide and initialize some variables in the "guide.rb" file.
Give the initialize method an argument (it takes the path to a file as argument).

Step 2: Create the Restaurant Class. This is referring to the argument taken by the "guide.rb" class, so we decide to put it in its own separate file inside a class.
